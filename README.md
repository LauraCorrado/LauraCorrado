## Hi there! 😊
</div>
My name is Laura, **JR Full Stack web dev**. I welcome you to my GitHub profile!

- 🌱 I am currently learning **React** and **Inertia.js**
- 🧠 My tech stack includes: HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, VueJS, PHP, Laravel, MySQL, jQuery and many tools such as Npm, Postman, Git, VsCode, Github (for personal projects and collaborations)
- ⚡ Fun facts: I hold a degree in Philosophy, with a specialization in Theoretical Philosophy. I'm a fan of Michel Foucault and have read all his books. Oh, by the way: I love reading - especially philosophical essays and works by classical authors (I know, sounds boring for some!). I'm passionate about politics, social issues and history. I also love cinematography in general and am particularly obsessed with board games and video games! My favorites include Monkey Island and The Last of Us.
- 🦝 If it wasn't clear from the profile picture, the **raccoon** is my guide animal.
